2024 update:

Unicode seems to be needed.


______________________________________________________________________________
Reading guide:

Keyboard is designated as two Halves: A and B.
Layers are numbered 0-4.
Rows are numbers 1-4.
Keys are numbered 1-5.
[HLRK]

So the A key would be A121, the Enter key would be B425.
