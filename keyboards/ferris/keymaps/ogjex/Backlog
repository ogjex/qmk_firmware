2024 update:
keyboard is now refactored and in master status

______________________________________________________________________________
Reading guide:

Keyboard is designated as two Halves: A and B.
Layers are numbered 0-4.
Rows are numbers 1-4.
Keys are numbered 1-5.
[HLRK]

So the A key would be A121, the Enter key would be B425.

Backlog catalog:

- find out how other keyboards can reuse code

*D fix Danish special chars for keyboard

*D fix left and right skip arrow keys

*D add modtap for space ands shift

*D kc_no currently sends m_ques macro

- create DK custom key codes for stronger readability of layout _SYMB

D* remove double hold gui from B142
    - Done

D* add gui key unregister somewhere, maybe W?
    - already implemented as A141 when Held and released

* add repeat key while held for left and right skip hold
    - code is not pretty, needs refactor due to code duplication
    - needs to have separate static variables for all functions to properly call cur_dance in reset function (?)

- add combo keys:
    - add combo_keys definition in rules.mk
    - combo key for enter in _qwerty layer
    - combo key for backspace _qwerty layer

D* add double hold for B142 ctrl+shift and triple hold for ctrl+shift+alt

D* add plus for hold tap dances in _SYMB

D* add new layer with F keys

D* remove shift from A141 and replace with Windows key

D* make a mod tap for A141 layers 1+
    * set tapping term to very little
    * make sure that the key is actually held on layers 1-4
    * [bug] does not distinguish between tap and hold (hold is called even though it is a tap)
    - layer on is not called correctly (but worked 3 days ago)

- fix local switch ctrl+tab in VS Code

- add macro for capital letter after .

- find out how to do a tapdance in oneshot layer
    - test using held oneshot modifier

- add macro for (), [], {} when double tapped

- add macro for `, `` and ```, ", ' when double and/or triple tapped

- add macro functions that are called instead of embedding them in tapdance.c

D*- refactor code into low coupled architecture so it can be shared with other 34 keyboard layouts
