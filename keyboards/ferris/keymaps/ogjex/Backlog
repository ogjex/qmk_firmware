2024 update:

Unicode seems to be needed.

Reading guide:

Keyboard is designated as two Halves: A and B.
Layers are numbered 0-4.
Rows are numbers 1-4.
Keys are numbered 1-5.
[HLRK]

So the A key would be A121, the Enter key would be B425.

Backlog catalog:

- add macros that send string chars
    - works now, but requires unicode add ons

- add unicodes for:
    - !
    - "
    - #
    - $
    - %
    - &
    - /
    - ()
    - =
    - ?
    - +
    - ^
    - ~
    - Â¨
    - `
    - ``
    - ```
    - 0-9

*D fix left and right skip arrow keys

*D add modtap for space ands shift

*D kc_no currently sends m_ques macro

- remove double hold from B142

- add double tap for B142 ctrl+shift

- remove shift from A141 and replace with Windows key

*D make a mod tap for A141 layers 1+
    * set tapping term to very little
    * make sure that the key is actually held on layers 1-4
    * [bug] does not distinguish between tap and hold (hold is called even though it is a tap)
    - layer on is not called correctly (but worked 3 days ago)

- fix local switch ctrl+tab in VS Code

- add macro for capital letter after .

- add macro for (), [], {} when double tapped

- refactor code into low coupled architecture so it can be shared with other 34 keyboard layouts
